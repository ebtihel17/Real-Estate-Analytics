# Real Estate Analytics
- The Real Estate Analytics dashboard is designed to deliver a clear, data-driven understanding of market trends and performance.
- In this project, the data follows a star schema, with a central ‘Transactions’  fact table connected to four dimension tables: ‘Agents’, ‘Customers’, ‘Properties’, and ‘Location’. Each dimension table holds attributes specific to its corresponding entity, while the ‘Transactions’ table captures transactional data, linking the dimensions together.
- The dashboard begins with an overview page and includes six additional sections: Transaction Analysis, Property Insights, Agent Performance, Demographics, Time Analysis, and Location Insights. Each section provides detailed insights, highlighting a specific aspect of the real estate market.
